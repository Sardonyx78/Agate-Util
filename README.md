# Agate Util

This tool allows you to load your addon files dynamically

## Features
- [x] Facilitates file loadding
- [x] Clean logging

## Usage

The addon is designed to be used with [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix). But you can work without it if you always `prioritize` or just edit the `sh_agate_utils.lua:94`.<br><br>
It will load the files **alphabetically** meaning that you can set order of files loading, but don't forget the the recursion load isn't flat: so a folder's files will be prioritized if the folder's name is greater at the alphabetical order.

### Folder Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ addons
  ðŸ“‚ your_addon_name
    ðŸ“‚ lua
      ðŸ“‚ autorun
         ðŸ“„ your_addon_name_init.lua
      ðŸ“‚ your_addon_name
         ðŸ“„ cl_init.lua (You can name it whatever you want, it's just an example)
         ðŸ“„ sv_init.lua (same)
         ðŸ“„ sh_init.lua (same again smh)
         ðŸ“‚ example_folder_again
            ðŸ“„ sh_things.lua (an example again, this will load too)
```
and in the `your_addon_name_init.lua` file
```lua
if not AgateUtil then
     hook.Add("AgateUtilReady", "your_addon_name", function()
          AgateUtil:LoadAddon("your_addon_name", false)
     end)
else
     AgateUtil:LoadAddon("your_addon_name", false)
end
```

## Functions

```lua
-- Load an addon
AgateUtil:LoadAddon(addon_name, prioritized)
```
- addon_name `string`
  - The addon's name to load
- prioritized `boolean`
  - Should the addon load before Helix

***

```lua
-- Fancy console log
AgateUtil:Log(addon_name, ...)
```
- addon_name `string`
  - The addon's name to load
- prioritized `boolean`
  - Should the addon load before Helix
- Example: 
  ```lua
  SardonUtil:Log("Sardon Ä°ksir", AgateUtil.colors.purple, ply:Nick(), AgateUtil.colors.yellow, " used ", AgateUtil.colors.blue, "[" .. pot_name .. "]")
  ```
